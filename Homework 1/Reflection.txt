I was totally expecting ChatGPT to create something I would deem better than what I've created. But Alas it did not.
ChatGPT does not take into account backgrounds, props, perspective, or themes. It just gave a flat 2D semi recognizable steak-like object.

The strength of AI is that it can help us to learn or revise certain things. But by nature, it is purely an analytical machine. It does not think critically or creatively, it only thinks to collect and display data.
