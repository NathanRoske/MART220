This project was definitely very confusing at first, having to use external resources and plugins for anything to display.
Nonetheless, it was a good way to demonstrate the streamlined workflow of having assets orginized into their own neat packages.
Each of the three images I added on top of the prior p5 project. Two of the images I pulled from image searches, then I used ChatGPT for the one on the right. That being said, I accidentally shrank it down too much and had to bring it back to a reasonable size,
hence it got compressed. But ChatGPT has fairly accurate artwork for a ribeye I must say. A couple years ago if the Will Smith Spaghetti video is anything to go by, the Ribeye would be merely a meat shaped blob. I find ChatGPT's image generation
more widely known and so I stuck with it for the assignment.

I had to use all kinds of resources, such as the examples from the external website and the sample piece for the class. As I am still learning the how and why of code, given the need for each line to be specific down to even
the spelling, syntax, and punctuation. In other words the references carried me for this assignment.
